* Fix up what I have, then combobox

* clean_up not being called. Ws before?
* icons in gtable, gcomobobx, ..
* stock icons are slow (.3sec. could cache, could use urls...)

DONE * rename gWidgetsWWW2.rapache
DONE * get_id from data base, not ..id..
* transport? Embed into a handler? 

handler <- function(h,...) {
  set_value(h$obj) <- h$params$value
}

* editing a data frame? Not as critical as uploading data
