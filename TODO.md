Containers
-----------
* gnotebook
DONE * gstackwidget
* gborderlayout
* for now, no glayout or gpanedgroup


Widgets
-------
* gtable + visible<-; infinite scrolling, multiple selection, icon+tooltip column
* form stuff labels, ... no resizing of radio, checkboxgroup, .., but we should implement names<-, length
* icons in gtable, gcomobobx, ..
* editing a data frame? Not as critical as uploading data

Plumbing
--------
* static files, temp_urls, ...
DONE * need to limit serach for scripts (script_base=c("example_dir", "/tmp", ...)) i.e. relative to this
* clean_up being called?
* stock icons are slow (.3sec. could cache, could use urls...)
DONE * handlers: block/unblock all for obje
DONE * rename gWidgetsWWW2.rapache
DONE * get_id from data base, not ..id..
